# Situation
ABC is a financial institution based out of India. They offer a range of banking services like Savings accounts, Current accounts, Investment products, Credit products etc.

# Task
In 2018, the firm launched a new investment product, “Term Deposit”, which has observed a rapid growth since its inception. The increase in term deposit accounts has provided the firm with additional funds to create other offerings. Hence, based on this performance, it further wants to increase its term deposit accounts amongst existing customers. In order to do so, the firm plans to run a campaign and wants to identify a list of customers who could be contacted via telecommunication channels to open a term deposit account with ABC. Since the campaign will be run for a short period of time, and owing to budget constraints, the firm wants a list of only 1000 customers for the target list.
